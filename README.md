# efc.jar
A crossposter for furry art to diverse furry art websites like FurAffinity, Weasyl, etc.

This forked version of the application is intended to be used with [CrosspostSharp](https://github.com/libertyernie/CrosspostSharp), providing upload support for additional sites. CrosspostSharp is written in C#/.NET, while this app is in Java.

Based on a merge of http://double-helix.industries/applications/furrycrossposter/ (1.3) and https://github.com/Lycantiger/Furry-Crossposter

Added:
* ability to pass an image (or a json file with info about an image) as a command line argument

Removed:
* splash screen
* gender options used primarily in explicit artwork
* DeviantArt, Furry Network, and Inkbunny support (CrosspostSharp supports these sites)
